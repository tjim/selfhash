# selfhash

selfhash is a program that takes a web page (HTML file) as input and produces a self-hashing web page as its output.

The output web page will be identical to the input page except that it will include a script that will calculate the SHA-1 hash of the output web page; that is, the output will calculate its own hash.

You must indicate where selfhash should insert the script by adding a line

    <!--selfhash-->

to the input.

REQUIREMENTS: tested on Linux using node.js.

Thanks to Chris Veness for the [JavaScript implementation of SHA-1](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha1.html).
